# osu-forum-flag-icons
> A collection of all country flags in PNG set to size 20x20 which is in line with osu! forum posts default font size

## Usage
You can download or link directly images from this repo to your post (I recommend /flags/3x4/).
To make it easier to use, I have shortened the url by redirecting them from my domain. You can use http://flag.malai.monster/XX.png to get the image, where XX is the two letter country code.

## Credits
- Wesley for being a really smart guy
- Flags in 1x1 format were converted from assets taken directly from [flag-icons](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons/tree/main) repo.
- Flags in 3x4 format were converted based on [osu](https://osu.ppy.sh/assets/images/flags) assets.
